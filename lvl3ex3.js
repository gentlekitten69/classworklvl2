/*
You're going to build a vowel counter. 
Given a string, count and print out the number of vowels in the string. 
For the purpose of this assignment, we will not consider y to be a vowel.
 
Example input: "Do you know where the mall is, Ellie?"

Example output:
Number of vowels: 12

//HINT: The string 'aeiou' has been provided for you if you 
//think it might be helpful. You might want to look into what
//the 'includes' method does and how it might be useful here.

const vowels = "aeiou";

//add your code below
let vowelCount = 0;
